Hi, I'm Nkateko Tibane, an aspiring offensive security researcher and systems enthusiast.

My work focuses on vulnerability research, exploit development, reverse engineering, and red teaming. This site is both my portfolio and lab notebook â€” a place where I document my learning, share tools and writeups, and publish insights from ongoing research.

I'm passionate about understanding how systems break and building the skills to responsibly test and secure them. When I'm not reversing binaries or solving CTFs, I'm usually building something technical or diving into OS internals.
