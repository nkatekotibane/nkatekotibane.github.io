# Offensive Security Blog & Portfolio

Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio, where I document my journey through offensive security, vulnerability research, and technical exploration. This site includes writeups, research, projects, and tools focused on real-world exploitation and adversarial techniques.

## üß† About Me
I'm an aspiring offensive security researcher passionate about breaking systems to understand how they work. My main interests include:

- Binary & kernel exploitation
- Reverse engineering
- Red teaming & post-exploitation
- Fuzzing & exploit development
- CTFs (Capture The Flag)

This site is my knowledge base, a space to learn in public, and showcase the work I‚Äôm most proud of.
