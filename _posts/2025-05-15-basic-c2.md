# Building Basic Command and Control Server

In order to understand how c2 servers work, I decided to build my on c2 in order to understand the internals of command and control servers. After a few weeks of researching and coding, I came up with a minimal basic c2 and implant. 
#### Goal
Build a working implant in C that connects to a Linux server over TLS and executes remote commands securely.

Please note, Basic-C2 is purely for educational purposes and is not designed for real-world engagements. It's a learning tool, and its basic functionality reflects that.

[You can find the command and control server and implant here](https://github.com/nkatekotibane/Basic-C2/) 
## Overview

### Server Side
The server is really simple. I wrote it for Linux . It sets up a secure TLS listener, accepts incoming connections, and spawns a thread for each client. 
From there:
- Type command
- It sends it to implant via TLS
- The implant executes it
- It sends back the output

The c2 server also has some basic logging functionality.

Thanks to OpenSSL's abstrations things are a bit simple to make the server use TLS communications

The shell logic reads commands from the operator and forwards them via `SSL_write()`. The client reads them, runs them, and returns the output.

This is super basic, but it works.

### Client Side (Implant)
I wrote the implant for the windows operating system, the implant basically resembles a backdoor (or a basic RAT). the implant uses Schannel API for encrypted TLS communication. Schannel was really hard to deal with, it took me days to get around. How the implant works: 
- Try to connect to c2 server
- Receive and execute commands using `_popen`
- Send output back to c2 server

Unlike OpenSSL, Schannel doesn’t abstract everything. You manually manage the encryption handshake, message buffers, and stream decryption.

This gives more control — and more complexity. But it avoids shipping OpenSSL with the implant, keeping it lightweight and native.

### Server

#### Socket Programming
The server uses socket programming with SSL/TLS to communicate with implants.

The server first creates a socket 
```c
serverSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (serverSock == -1) {
    perror("Socket creation failed");
    return -1;
}
```

Then binds address: It binds the socket and address structure together. 
The address structure contains the following:
- IP Address
- Port
- Transport Protocol (TCP)
- IP version (4)

```c
    if (bind(serverSock, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(addr))) {
        perror("binding failed");
        close(serverSock);
        return -1;
    }
```

The server then listens for incoming connections

```c
    if (listen(serverSock, 20) == -1) {
        perror("Listen Failed");
        close(serverSock);
        return -1;
    }
```

Another function accepts connections (ONLY SSL/TLS).

The function first ssl certs if they do not exits from a function in the `certifications.h` header and then it loads them into the program.
```c
if (access("certs/cert.pem", F_OK) != 0 && access("certs/key.pem", F_OK) != 0) {
    generate_key_and_cert();
}

SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file(ctx, "certs/cert.pem", SSL_FILETYPE_PEM);
SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, "certs/key.pem", SSL_FILETYPE_PEM);
```

The server is setup that it will count down from 10 and accept connections in that time and if there is a connection the timer resets, if there are connections the program performs a TLS handshake and accepts connection. 
Here is how i implanted it

```c
    int duration = 10; // default duration is 10 seconds

    start:
    do {
        memset((void*)&client_addr, 0, len);
        memset((void*)&agentSock, 0, sizeof(agentSock));
        printf("[-] Waiting for connections\n");
        // add log "Waiting for connections"

        // wait 
        fd_set read_fds;
        struct timeval timeout;
        FD_ZERO(&read_fds);
        FD_SET(serverSock, &read_fds);

        timeout.tv_sec = duration;
        timeout.tv_usec = 0;

        // Wait for a connection or timeout
        int activity = select(serverSock + 1, &read_fds, NULL, NULL, &timeout);
        if (activity < 0) {
            perror("select error");
            sleep(1);
            goto start;
        }

        if (activity == 0) {
            // Timeout occurred, no connection
            printf("[-] No connection within %d seconds. Continuing...\n", duration);
            sleep(1);
            break;
        } else {
            // Connection is available
            if (FD_ISSET(serverSock, &read_fds)) {
                agentSock = accept(serverSock, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &len);
                if (agentSock == -1) {
                    perror("Accept Failed");
                    return -1;
                }
                
                SSL *ssl = SSL_new(ctx);
                SSL_set_fd(ssl, agentSock);
                // perform tls handshake
                if (SSL_accept(ssl) <= 0) {
                    perror("TLS handshake Failed");
                    ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
                    SSL_free(ssl);
                    close(agentSock);
                    return -1;
                }

```

After accepting connections we increment the connections counter variable  and connection to a list (this is all logged from `log.h`).  

```c
                char ip[buffer_len];
                strncpy(ip, inet_ntoa(client_addr.sin_addr), sizeof(ip));
                connections_counter++;
                printf("[+] Connection from %s | shell %d \n", ip, connections_counter);
                log_connections(ip);
                addAgent(agentSock, ip, ssl);
                sleep(1);
                continue;
            }
        }
        } while (true);

```

## Why I built this
I was curious with how red-team command and control work under the hood.
I wanted to understand the **lower-level mechanics**. Writing this from scratch in C — and with native APIs — gave me deep insight into how TLS, sockets, and remote execution work under the hood.
